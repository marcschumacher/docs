= Linux

== Networking

* alternative `traceroot` with Curses interface: `sudo mtr <hostname>`

== Shellscripting

* Redirect all output to `/dev/null`: `<myprogram> &> /dev/null`
* Find out the path of the script: `realpath $0`
* Use default value if a value is not existing: `MY_VARIABLE=$(EMPTY_VARIABLE:-123)` means: if `$EMPTY_VARIABLE` does not have a value, assign `123` (not `-123`!).
* Use Pipeviewer `pv` (see http://www.ivarch.com/programs/pv.shtml) for progress bar of long running tasks using pipes

== Tools

=== less

* search with ignore case: inside less press `-i` while the colon on the bottom appears. That way you switch to ignore case in searches. After that simply search.
